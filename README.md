This is a **Telegram bot** that assists students preparing to sit for the Iranian National-wide University Entrance Exam. Every day, a new set of exams can be provided to the students through this bot.

This bot utilizes the **Flask framework** and the **Python** programming language. The scores of students are calculated by storing the history of exams taken by each student in an **SQLite database**. Additionally, the **FSM approach** is employed to develop a defense mechanism against **DoS Flooding Attacks**.
