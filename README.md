This is a **Telegram Bot** that helps students who are about to participate in Iranian Nation-wide University Entrance Exam. 
Through this Bot, every day a set of new exams can be provided which the students are supposed to take. 

This Bot is developed based on **Flask framework** in **Python**.
A **SQLite database** is employed to store the history of taken exams for each student using which the scores of students are calculated. 
In addition, using **FSM approach**, a defense machanism against **DoS Flooding Attack** is developed.
